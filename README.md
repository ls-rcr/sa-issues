# sa-issues
The issue tracker for bugs/requests/suggestions of the website and server.

## What
This is an issue tracker repository. In here, you can report bugs, ask for features/suggestions, and check their progress as developers work on them.
Basically, this works in some way as a "dev log" for the community - you will not be able to access the code (that is private, and only developers can access it), but you can see what is being worked on and the progress being made.

## Why 
The current ecosystem is difficult for everyone involved: players, devs, and staff. We essentially have 3/4 points of possible information (our dev logs, the suggestions forum, discord, and private *code related* reports) so it becomes very confusing for us to stay up to speed with things, and for you to know what progress is being made. 
This repository has the objective of being the go-to location for all the information related to the website and server.

## How

### Players
You will be able to [create an issue](https://github.com/ls-rcr/sa-issues/issues) in the same way that you would have made a suggestion/bug report/etc. Once you click to create a new issue, a template will be filled out for you; you just need to complete it according to what your suggestion/bug report/etc. is about as instructed. It is not intended to be a difficult process, all you need to do is to have a free GitHub account and you can participate! Thanks for your help, and remember to stay civilized. Any hateful/rude/otherwise inappropriate messages will be either edited or deleted.

### Devs
You will be able to link commits, PR's, and other info to/from the source code (private repository). More details in a separate document, that will be created later and linked here when it is completed.

### Staff
You will be able to mark/close suggestions/bug reports/etc as needed, and help regulate that valid issues are created, discussion remains appropriate, etc. More details in a separate document, that will be created later and linked here when it is completed.
